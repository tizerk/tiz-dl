# ytiz

_ytiz_ is a user-friendly GUI for downloading YouTube videos (yt-dlp) with no ads, premium plans, and general clutter.

`I've decided to stop working on ytiz due to exceedingly slow conversion speed between video formats.  Release 1.0.0 will work fine for most downloads, but conversions are too slow to be usable.  I'm now working on a web-based audio/video downloader also based on yt-dlp, available here:` [tiz-dl](https://github.com/tizerk/tiz-dl)
